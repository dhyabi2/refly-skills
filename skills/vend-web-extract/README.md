# vend-web-extract

Extract clean, readable text/markdown from a web page, paid per call with a
single Nano (XNO) on-chain payment via the x402 rail. No API key, no signup,
no card on file — the Nano wallet is the account.

## Why

Web extraction is a common agent need, but most solutions require an API key, a
signup, or a card on file. `vend-web-extract` uses an endpoint that answers
HTTP 402 with an x402 payment challenge — you settle a single **0.0001 XNO**
payment on-chain in about a second at zero fee, then the call returns the
content. Removes the signup/key step for paid web extraction.

## Installation

Drop this directory into your skills path (e.g. as a Claude Code or Cursor
skill), or use any tool that loads SKILL.md-based skills.

## What it does

1. `GET .../extract?url=<URL>` → HTTP 402 with `price_xno` / `pay_to`.
2. Pay exactly `price_xno` XNO to `pay_to` from your own wallet.
3. Retry with the settled block hash as `X-PAYMENT` → HTTP 200 + clean text.

See `SKILL.md` for the full runbook.
